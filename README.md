MCNotifier
==========

What is it?
-----------

MCNotifier is a Bukkit plugin and application which would notify you on your smart-phones, smart-watches, almost any smart devices on suspicious activity on your server, server shutdowns, server startups, and notifications you can configure to be informed on or not.

How is MCNotifier supposed to help me? It might.

As of right now, I only have a very general idea for what I want this to come out as. If you have ANY ideas for the plugin, feel free to contact me at contact@mazenmc.io or PM me on Bukkit or BukkitDev
